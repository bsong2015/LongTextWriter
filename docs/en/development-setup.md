# Development Setup

To run the entire application (backend server and frontend UI) in development mode with hot-reloading, use the following command from the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will concurrently start:
-   The backend server for the web UI.
-   The Vite development server for the Vue.js frontend.

The web UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).
