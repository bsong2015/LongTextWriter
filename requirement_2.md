# LongTextWriter - Requirement Document (v2.0 - Local Web-based UI)

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the functional requirements for the proposed local web-based user interface (UI) version of the LongTextWriter application. This version aims to provide a more intuitive and visually rich experience for managing, generating, and publishing long-form text content, while retaining all functionalities of the CLI version.

## 2. Core Features

### 2.1 Project/Document Management (Web UI)
*   **Dashboard/Project List:** A web-based dashboard displaying all projects/documents.
    *   **Requirement:** Visually list projects with key information (name, status, last modified, word count).
    *   **Requirement:** Provide search, filter, and sort capabilities for projects.
    *   **Requirement:** Intuitive UI for creating new projects/documents.
        *   **Requirement:** Form-based input for project name, type, and initial settings.
    *   **Requirement:** Easy access to project actions (edit, delete, view status) via UI elements (e.g., buttons, context menus).
        *   **Requirement:** Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions like deletion.
    *   **Requirement:** Visual representation of project status (e.g., progress bars, icons).

### 2.2 Content Editing & Generation (Web UI)
*   **Outline Generation Interface:** A dedicated UI for generating and managing outlines.
    *   **Requirement:** Interactive outline editor (drag-and-drop reordering, adding/removing sections).
    *   **Requirement:** Visual feedback during outline generation process.
    *   **Requirement:** Integration with the main content editor for easy insertion of outline points.
*   **Content Generation Workflows:** UI elements to trigger and monitor content generation processes.
    *   **Requirement:** Forms or wizards for configuring `run` commands.
    *   **Requirement:** Display of generation progress and output logs within the UI.

### 2.3 Publishing (Web UI)
*   **Publishing Interface:** A dedicated section for configuring and initiating publishing.
    *   **Requirement:** Dropdown or selection for output formats (Markdown, HTML, PDF).
    *   **Requirement:** Configuration forms for publishing destinations (e.g., API keys, folder paths).
    *   **Requirement:** Visual feedback on publishing status (success/failure).
    *   **Requirement:** Option to download generated files directly from the UI.

## 3. Internationalization (i18n) (Web UI)
*   **Language Selector:** A UI element (e.g., dropdown in header/settings) to switch languages.
    *   **Requirement:** All UI text and messages should be localized based on selected language.

## 4. Configuration (Web UI)
*   **Settings Panel:** A web-based settings panel for managing application configurations.
    *   **Requirement:** UI forms for editing environment variables or application-specific settings.
    *   **Requirement:** Secure handling of sensitive information (e.g., API keys).

## 5. Technical Requirements
*   **Architecture:** Local web server (e.g., Node.js/Express) serving a frontend application (e.g., React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS).
*   **Backend:** Re-use existing TypeScript core logic where possible.
*   **Frontend:** Responsive design for various screen sizes.
*   **Data Storage:** Local file system for content and project metadata.
*   **Dependencies:** Managed via `package.json`.
*   **Build Process:** Standard web development build tools (e.g., Webpack, Vite).

## 6. User Experience (UX) Goals
*   **Intuitive Interface:** Easy to navigate and understand for new users.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clear indications of ongoing processes, success, and errors.
